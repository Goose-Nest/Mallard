# Mallard

Mallard is an open-source, public domain, cross-platform, and lightweight GooseMod installer with really bad code written in Nim.

# Compatibility

Mallard works on Windows, Linux, and MacOS. If you'd like to add more operating systems, feel free to submit a pull request.

# Building

I provided some build scripts in `Mallard.nimble` that can be called with `nimble debug` and `nimble release`.
